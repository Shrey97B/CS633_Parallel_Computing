# CS633_Parallel_Computing
This repository contains the programming assignment for the course CS633-Parallel Computing (Spring 2021).
The assignments involved working over MPICH (an implementation of MPI) to perform distributed computation through message passing for data sharing.

## Assignment 1
Implemented Halo Exchange to perform Average Stencil Computation over four neighbors. The program demonstrated the idea of distributing the entire domain computation into subdomains and handling data sharing through message passing.

## Assignment 2
Attempted to improve some MPI collective calls considering the Network Topology by forming Groups among processes and using sub-communicators to efficiently communicate data between them.

## Assignment 3
Performed Year-Wise and overall Minimum Temperature computation over several thousand stations demonstrating the use of Message Passing Interface to perform data computation and analysis through distributed computing.
